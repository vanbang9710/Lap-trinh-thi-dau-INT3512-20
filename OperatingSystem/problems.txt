Chapter 4 problems
Problem 1.
	A system has 16 tapes, and 4 processes P0, P1, P2 , P3with corresponding requests:
	P0 requests at most 10 tapes
	P1 requests at most 4 tapes
	P2 requests at most 9 tapes
	P3 requests at most 5 tapes
	At t0, P0 has 5 tapes, P1 and P2 each has 2 tapes , P3 has 3 tapes
	4 tapes available
	Is the system safe with Banker’s algorithm?

	At t1, P0 has 7 tapes, P1 and P2 each has 2 tapes , P3 has 3 tapes
	2 tapes available
	Is the system safe with Banker’s algorithm?

	At t2, P0 has 7 tapes, P1 has 3 tapes, P2 each has 2 tapes, P3 has 3 tapes
	1 tapes available
	Is the system safe with Banker’s algorithm?
	At t3, P0 has 7 tapes, P1 has 3 tapes, P2 each has 2 tapes, P3 has 4 tapes
	0 tape available
	Is the system safe with Banker’s algorithm?
 
Problem 2
	5 processes: P0 - P4; 3 resource types
	A (10 instances),  B (5 instances), and C (7 instances)
	At time T0:
			Allocation	Max	Available
			A B C	A B C 	A B C
		P0	1 1 0	7 5 3 	3 3 2
		 P1	1 0 0 	3 2 2
		 P2	2 0 2 	9 0 2
		 P3	2 1 1 	2 2 2
		 P4	1 0 2	4 3 3
Is the system safe with banker’s algorithm?
 
PROBLEM 3
	5 processes: P0 - P4; 3 resource types
	A (10 instances),  B (5 instances), and C (7 instances)
			Allocation	Max	Available
			A B C	A B C	A B C
		P0	0 1 2 	7 5 3 	3 3 2
		P1	2 0 0	3 2 2
		P2	3 0 1 	9 0 2
		P3	2 1 1 	2 2 2
		P4	0 0 1 	4 3 3
	If P1 requests for (1,0,2) => can it be granted
	If P4 requests for (1,0,0) => can it be granted?
	If P0 requests for (0, 2, 0) => can it be granted?
	If P1 requests for (1,0,2) => can it be granted
	If P1’s request is granted, can the next request for (1,0,0) by P4 be granted?
	If P1 requests for (1,0,2) => can it be granted
	If P1’s request is granted, can the request for (0,2,0) by P0 be granted?
 
PROBLEM 4

	5 processes: P0 - P4; 3 resource types
	A (10 instances),  B (5 instances), and C (7 instances)
	At snapshot at time T0
			 Allocation	Request	Available
			A B C 	A B C 	A B C
		P0	0 1 0 	1 0 0 	4 3 1
		P1	2 0 0 	2 0 2
		P2	2 0 3	0 0 0
		P3	2 1 1 	1 0 0
		P4	0 0 2 	0 0 2

	Is there a deadlock at T0  ?
	If P2 request (0, 0, 1), is there a deadlock?
