G https://vjudge.net/problem/UVA-540/origin 1 Queue containing indexes of t Queues
I https://vjudge.net/problem/UVA-11034/origin 2 Queues for 2 river sides
E https://vjudge.net/problem/UVA-732/origin Backtrack with Branch and Bound. n is string length.
    AC: The number of 'i' and 'o' is both <= n
